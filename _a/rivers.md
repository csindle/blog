### [River Levels](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSrvfmAJjNp7dg7eLW6P2ZQs09h-TpATIjnaUL8U9JCdee6Y6lmWLX4CdWaTsNBD_IykDDUURLJ7kFZ/pubhtml?gid=1920985366&single=true)

I find it a bit challenging navigating the South African Department of Water Affairs' website to find the river flow gauge levels.
The above spread-sheet link contains permanent (at least non-expiring), direct, URLs to the charts 
that you are probably looking for (cumec flows, and level heights).

Please contact me if any of the links are broken.
